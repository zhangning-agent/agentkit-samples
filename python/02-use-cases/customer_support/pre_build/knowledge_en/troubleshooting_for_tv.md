## Smart TV Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps users troubleshoot common smart TV issues such as no power, display abnormalities, and no signal.

### TV won’t power on

**Power check**
1. Verify the outlet has power (test with another device).
2. Check the power cable is firmly connected and try another outlet.
3. Unplug for 2-3 minutes, plug back in, wait 30 seconds, then power on.

**Remote check**
1. Replace batteries and confirm correct polarity.
2. Use a phone camera to check for IR light when pressing buttons.
3. Use the TV’s physical power button to rule out remote issues.

**Further checks**
1. Inspect the cable for damage or burning smell near the back panel.
2. Ensure proper ventilation to avoid thermal shutdown.

### Screen glitches or abnormal display

**Input source**
1. Switch input sources and try another HDMI port.
2. Disconnect external devices and test the TV alone.

**Cables**
1. Reseat or replace the HDMI cable.
2. Check antenna connection and rescan channels.

**Screen diagnosis**
1. Full static usually indicates a signal issue; color bars or partial artifacts may indicate panel or mainboard issues.
2. Open the TV menu: if the menu is normal but content is not, it’s likely signal-related; if the menu is also distorted, it may be hardware.

### No signal

**Basics**
1. Confirm the correct input is selected and the external device is powered on.
2. Ensure all cables are securely connected and not damaged.

**Device-side**
1. Verify output settings on the set-top box/game console.
2. Power cycle the external device and retry.

**TV settings**
1. Adjust resolution settings to match the output.
2. For 4K devices, check if HDMI enhanced mode is enabled.
